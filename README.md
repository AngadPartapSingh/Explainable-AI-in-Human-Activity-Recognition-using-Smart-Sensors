# Explainable-AI-in-Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smart-Sensors
Created several ML models for Predictive Analysis in Human Activity Recognition. Validated the results using Explainable AI.
This was my Dissertation project for my Masters in Data Science.
With the use of Smart Sensors, we recorded the activities of different people.
Using the data, we were able to apply ML models, to analyze and predict the future activities.
The models comparison was done so as to check which model gave the best predictions.
The further validation of the output was done using the concept of Explainable AI.
Incorporating Explainable AI, using LIME & SHAP values, we were able to deduce which feature, from our dataset, helped (to what extent) in the overall predictions.
We have also discussed about WHY the DL models arent suited for such predictions (as we know they are time and resource consuming).
Explainable AI is a very unique concept, ever used in the field of HUman Activity Recognition.
I received DISTINCTION in my report and was also approached by my Professor to submit a Journal based on this whole concept.
